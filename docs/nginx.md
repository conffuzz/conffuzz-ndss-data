# Nginx Worker-Master CIV

## Threat model

In Nginx, the master/worker split is partly justified by security: privileged
operations are performed in the master (running as `root`), which is not
exposed to the network.

We are thus looking for "worker escape" vulnerabilities: assuming the worker is
compromised, we want to find vulnerabilities that allow it to compromise the
master, to further escalate privileges.

## Worker-Escape CIV

We found a worker escape CIV via the shared memory mutex API.

Here is a description step by step of the vulnerability:

1. A compromised guest corrupts the mutex structure in the `ngx_slab_pool_t`,
   in shared memory. Specifically, it corrupts [the lock pointer](https://hg.nginx.org/nginx/file/tip/src/core/ngx_shmtx.h#l26).
   This requires a single byte write.
2. The guest wants to force the master to dereference this corrupted pointer,
   in order to do that it crashes itself to trigger the [mutex cleanup mechanism](https://hg.nginx.org/nginx/file/default/src/os/unix/ngx_process.c#l602).
   NOTE: this could actually also happen naturally when the server shuts down.
3. As the guest dies, the master receives a SIGCHILD and executes
   `ngx_unlock_mutexes()`. In doing so it dereferences the corrupted `lock()`
   pointer and crashes. Dereference can be READ or WRITE.

Here is a proof of concept that demonstrates the vulnerability:

1. Compile Nginx with ASan, here we went for 1.21.6 but it should work on more
   recent releases.
2. Apply the following patch:
```
diff -ur nginx-1.21.6.old/src/os/unix/ngx_process_cycle.c nginx-1.21.6/src/os/unix/ngx_process_cycle.c

```
3. Run `./objs/nginx -g 'error_log stderr debug;'`
4. You should see the following crash appear:

```

The patch is very simple, it (1) just corrupts the mutex from the worker's
context, (2) kills itself (`* (volatile int *) NULL = 0`) to (3) trigger the
mutex cleanup mechanism in the master, which triggers the crash. Again, the
worker killing itself is not necessary, the crash would also happen at server
shutdown.

The pointer does not have to be a NULL pointer, but we set it to NULL in this PoC.

## Impact

In theory, such exploits could be mounted on this vulnerability to compromise
the master from the guest.

In practice this particular CIV is limited in impact due to control constraints
in the mutex unlocking routine: bytes will only be overwritten if they match
the workerâ€™s PID. Nevertheless, CIVs at such interfaces present a real risk:
less constrained bugs are realistic and may pose a real privilege escalation
threat.

## Fix

A link to the fix will be provided here when available.
