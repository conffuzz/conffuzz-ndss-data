bzip2-shared: Compressed file ends unexpectedly;
	perhaps it is corrupted?  *Possible* reason follows.
bzip2-shared: Success
	Input file = example.bz2, output file = example

It is possible that the compressed file(s) have become corrupted.
You can use the -tvv option to test integrity of such files.

You can use the `bzip2recover' program to attempt to recover
data from undamaged sections of corrupted files.

bzip2-shared: Deleting output file example, if it exists.
